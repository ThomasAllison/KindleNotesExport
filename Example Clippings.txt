Deze akkertjes werden in het verleden aangelegd om zomerpeen, aardbeien en aardappelen op te laten groeien. Vaak werden stukken grond afgegraven tot aan de vochtige ondergrond. Veel van deze akkertjes werden in loop der tijd niet meer gebruikt, waardoor ze al snel begroeiden met een verstikkend pak gras. Om te voorkomen dat deze gebieden ontoegankelijk werden, zette men grazers in. Ook koos men er soms voor om de voedzame bodem af te gegraven. Hierdoor kwam er ruimte voor weiland met laag gras. Dit is de ideale plek voor het groeien van kaalkopjes.

Het puntig kaalkopje (psilocybe semilanceata) is de bekendste. Deze komt vooral voor in het oosten van het land. Bijna alle informatie over kaalkopjes op Internet gaat over deze soort.

Het slijmrandkaalkopje is te onderscheiden aan een slijmrandje net onder de lamellen. Dit randje kun je er vanaf trekken als een soort van elastiekje. Het blauwvoet kaalkopje heeft een iets blauwere voet dan de andere kaalkopjes. Het puntig kaalkopje, de naam zegt het al, heeft een puntige hoed.

Kaalkopjes worden beschouwd als hele lieve en vriendelijke paddenstoelen. Het zijn tevens sociale paddenstoelen. Met andere woorden je wordt er empathisch van, je gaat veel kletsen en vaak wordt je ook vrolijk. Soms ontstaan er lachkicks. Kaalkopjes resulteren meestal niet in sterke hallucinaties zoals de Hawaiiaanse paddenstoelen kunnen opwekken. Wel kunnen ze leiden tot diepere inzichten.

Vaak wordt beweerd dat het gevaarlijk is om paddenstoelen te plukken en op te eten. Dit is echter zeer overdreven. Er zijn inderdaad een aantal zeer giftige paddenstoelen, maar dat geldt evengoed voor bessen en die durven mensen ook te plukken en te eten. Wanneer je kaalkopjes gaat plukken dan moet je weten dat er enkele giftige paddenstoelen zijn die op kaalkopjes lijken. De mate van giftigheid van deze gelijkende paddenstoelen is echter gering. Mocht je een giftige soort plukken die op een kaalkopje lijkt dan loop je de kans om misselijk te worden en in het ergste geval te gaan braken.

Ze hebben een kegelvormige hoed met een spits bultje. Deze is 5 tot 15 mm in doorsnee en 6 tot 13 mm hoog. Als ze vers zijn, zijn ze olijfgroen tot grijsbruin. Laat je ze drogen dan verkleuren ze naar strogeel tot okerkleurig. De sporen zijn zwart tot paarsachtig-bruin. De lamellen zijn bleek bruin-grijs tot purperbruin.

Wanneer je wat citroensap aan de paddenstoelenthee toevoegt, wordt de psilocybine in het water omgezet in psilocine. Zoals eerder gezegd is het de psilocine die verantwoordelijk is voor het psychedelische effect. Citroensap zorgt er dus voor dat de trip sneller begint. Als bijkomend voordeel heb je ook minder last van je maag.

Paddenstoelen die gekweekt worden zijn qua sterkte redelijk constant. Kaalkopjes komen alleen in de natuur voor, waardoor de sterkte varieert. De sterkte hangt namelijk af van het moment wanneer je ze plukt. Omdat de psilocybine alleen onder het vel wordt aangemaakt, zullen (bij een gelijk gewicht) kleine paddenstoelen ten opzichte van grote paddenstoelen sterker zijn. Probeer er daarom eerst tien á vijftien uit en kijk wat het effect is. Bepaal op deze manier de juiste dosis voor een volgende trip. Besef wel dat na een trip het een paar weken duurt, voordat je weer een optimaal effect zult ervaren. Daarom is het verstandig om de kaalkopjes te laten drogen, zodat je er langere tijd plezier van kunt hebben.

When done properly, HIIT offers many benefits over other, more traditional types of cardio workouts and other exercise programs. • Increases metabolism: The intensity of the HIIT workout boosts metabolism for up to 48 hours after completing a full routine. Production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH) is stimulated which helps to increase caloric burn, especially fat, as well as slows the aging process. • Increases ‘afterburn effect’: HIIT sessions increase the body’s need for oxygen during recovery – ‘Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption’ (EPOC) – which helps burn more fat and calories than even-paced workouts of a long duration or traditional aerobic activity. • Improves aerobic capacity in about 2 weeks as much as 6 to 8 weeks of traditional endurance training. • Improves heart health: HIIT gets you to the anaerobic zone quicker and more efficiently. • Reduces blood-sugar levels in Type 2 diabetics in as little as 2 weeks. • Eliminates exercise boredom: Short intervals and the incorporation of many different types of activities keep HIIT workouts fresh and motivating. • Challenging: With short-term goals, it is easy to see progress and feel success. • Quick: HIIT workouts should not last more than 20 or 30 minutes so they can fit into anyone’s schedule. • Convenient: HIIT can be performed anywhere with a minimum of equipment or just your own body weight so it is great for at home, on the road or in the gym.

The Fartlek Method is essentially interval training and can be adapted to virtually any activity although it was originally designed to improve the performance of runners. The main point of this method is to vary the intensity of portions of your workout, alternating slow and moderate paced movement with maximum intensity bursts.

Essentially, HIIT combines the concepts of interval and cross training for an overall, full-body workout at an intense level for maximum calorie burn and long-term residual effects. To compare HIIT to either type of workout – just intervals or just cross training - is to look at only half the picture. Additionally, any activity such as running or weight lifting that targets just one area or basic set of motions is incomplete in terms of overall fitness.

Intensity is measured differently for every individual and there are plenty of HIIT plans that allow you to get used to the demands of the program at your own pace. The beauty of HIIT is that is incorporates intense and moderate activity in a simple ratio so if you can’t sustain the hard work for 1 minute, aim for just 30 seconds and set your ‘recovery’ period accordingly. (Intervals and timing will be discussed in later chapters.).

Another area for concern with HIIT workouts is nutrition. It is important to understand not only your body’s overall caloric needs but also the sources of those calories in order to properly fuel your muscles for the demands you will place on them. HIIT creates much more complex physiological reactions within the body than traditional exercise routines.

I don’t like being inconvenienced, and I especially don’t like being inconvenienced too many times in a row. If something I don’t like happens, then several more things that I don’t like happen directly afterward, that is too many. They shouldn’t cluster like that. Unfortunately, that’s just how probability works.

Sometimes expectations arise as a result of an oversight on my part. But when there’s a snag in my plans because I failed to account for something, it still feels like reality’s fault.

Like all our memories, we like to take it out once in a while and lay it flat on the kitchen table, the way my wife does with her sewing patterns, where we line up the shape of our life against that which we thought it would be by now.
